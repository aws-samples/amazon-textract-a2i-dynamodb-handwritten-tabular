    "# Automate detection and augmentation of hand-written tabular content using Amazon Textract and Amazon A2I\n",
    "Organizations across industries have a large number of hand-written documents that require processing as part of their operations. Extracting data from these documents especially when there is a combination of printed and handwritten text is error-prone, time-consuming, expensive, and does not scale. Text being embedded in tables and forms adds to the extraction and processing complexity. Amazon Textract is a fully managed ML service that automatically extracts printed text, handwriting, and other data from scanned documents that goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data and text is extracted, the post processing step in a document management workflow involves reviewing the entries and make changes as needed. Amazon A2I makes it easy to integrate a human review into your ML workflow. This allows you to automatically have humans step into your ML pipeline to review results below a confidence threshold, set up review and auditing workflows, and augment the prediction results to improve model accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show you how to use Amazon Textract to extract the content of your forms containing hand-written text, setup and send to a human review loop, and augment the extracted invoice content for downstream processing.\n",

    "This post demonstrated how easy it is to use services in the AI layer of AWS AI/ML stack, such as Amazon Textract and Amazon A2I, to read and process tabular data from hand-written forms, and store them in a DynamoDB table for use by downstream applications. You can also send the augmented form data from Amazon A2I to an Amazon S3 bucket to be consumed by your AWS Analytics applications.\n",
