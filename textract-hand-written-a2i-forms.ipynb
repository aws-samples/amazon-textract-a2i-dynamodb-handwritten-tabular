    "# Automate hand-written tabular content using Amazon Textract and Amazon A2I\n",
    "Organizations across industries have a large number of hand-written documents that require processing as part of their operations. Extracting data from these documents especially when there is a combination of printed and handwritten text is error-prone, time-consuming, expensive, and does not scale. Text being embedded in tables and forms adds to the extraction and processing complexity. Amazon Textract is a fully managed ML service that automatically extracts printed text, handwriting, and other data from scanned documents that goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data and text is extracted, the post processing step in a document management workflow involves reviewing the entries and make changes as needed. Amazon A2I makes it easy to integrate a human review into your ML workflow. This allows you to automatically have humans step into your ML pipeline to review results below a confidence threshold, set up review and auditing workflows, and augment the prediction results to improve model accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show you how to use Amazon Textract to extract the content of your forms containing hand-written text, setup and send to a human review loop, and augment the extracted invoice content for downstream processing.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will now import the Amazon Textract Response Parser library to parse and extract what we need from Amazon Textract's response. There are two main functions here. One, we will extract the header data containing the document heading, and the form data (key-value pairs) part of the header section of the document. Two, we will parse the table and cells to create a csv file containing the tabular data. In this notebook, we will use the Textract Sync API for document extraction, [AnalyzeDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/API_AnalyzeDocument.html). This accepts image files (png or jpeg) as an input. For example, here is the code snippet for AnalyzeDocument:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    client = boto3.client(\n",
    "         service_name='textract',\n",
    "         region_name= 'us-east-1',\n",
    "         endpoint_url='https://textract.us-east-1.amazonaws.com',)\n",
    "         \n",
    "    response = client.analyze_document(Document={'Bytes': bytes_test}, FeatureTypes=['TABLES','FORMS'])\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if you would like to modify this notebook to use a PDF file or for batch processing of documents, use the [StartDocumentAnalysis API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/API_StartDocumentAnalysis.html). StartDocumentAnalysis returns a job identifier (JobId) that you use to get the results of the operation. When text analysis is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you specify in NotificationChannel. To get the results of the text analysis operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetDocumentAnalysis, and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartDocumentAnalysis."
